            The fact is, marketing financial services to consumers requires an understanding of how financial services marketing is different than other industries. Consumer demands and expectations have changed and there are 3 common themes that have been identified in the industry which we also see working with our clients:

    <h2> Introducing &mdash; The Marketing Funnel</h2>
     <p>Most financial services companies are still utilizing a very basic marketing/sales funnel, relying on customers to reach out to them as a result of brand communication efforts, or having their front-line salespeople performing cold calling to find new customers and generate sales.  What this ultimately means is that unless the potential customer is at the ready-to-buy stage by sheer luck of timing, theyre wasting time and being unproductive. There are three components to the marketing funnel and 5 stages</p>

       	    Most financial services companies are only operating at the bottom of the marketing funnel. However, only 10-20% of people are in the purchase stage, that means yourre missing out on 80-90% of potential customers unless you cater to their needs at the earlier stages.
By utilizing Marketing to create and publish content that will engage potential customers before they reach the <strong>Purchase</strong> stage, you can generate more leads for Sales of highly targeted, highly qualified people. Also, by connecting with a prospect before they are aware of their needs or when they are initially researching solutions and then providing them the content that they need, you can bring them through the different funnel stages.<br><br> Contrast this with the current approach of financial services companies, where prospects receive a cold call from the company, and if they are not ready to buy at that moment, that is the end of the discussion. What happens to these individuals? They had an ill-timed experience with the company but when the ideal time does come they will do their research and move through the funnel on their own. This will likely mean the prospect ends up purchasing from one of the following choices; the company that they usually deal with, whoever speaks to them first, or potentially the company that is top of mind when they do reach that Purchase stage. <br><br>
       </div>    
<div class = "col-span-1-of-4">
Youre probably reaching out to prospects currently, but theyre not quite ready to buy yet so the communication stops. What happens in a few weeks or months? A number of them will purchase from a competitor because when the prospect is ready to buy, another company has already engaged them. Often, its a matter of who engaged the prospect most recently.<br>

</div>

<div class = "col-span-1-of-4">
For many potential customers, navigating the purchase process for financial services can be rife with industry jargon, complex products, and impenetrable corporate layers and potentially aggressive sales people. Modern marketers are already removing some of these issues through publishing high quality content for these prospects and educating them throughout a pre planned buying journey.<br><br>
By doing so, these companies are providing sought-after clarity to potential customers in the form of educational content, guides, and plain words analysis. Prospects and customers feel more in control due to the nature of this <strong>pull</strong> style of consuming information. This clear, educational content serves to empower prospects and make them feel more comfortable, and in control. Often, this content is being distributed on social channels which opens a dialogue with the prospect on the communication channel they utilize most.<br><br>
	
</div>

<div class = "col-span-1-of-4">
Creating valuable content for your earliest stage prospects means that you establish your company as a trusted source of knowledge well before they get in touch with Sales. Coincidentally, that also significantly increases the rate at which they will continue on to make a purchase. <br><br>
<p class = "important"><strong>60% of a buyer's purchase decision has been made before they ever speak to a salesperson!</strong></p><br><br>
<p>That means that your content is doing the majority of the selling of your product or service! The important question is, are you investing as much in that content as you do in your Sales team?<br><br>
If you're like most companies, the answer to that question is <span class = "no"><strong>no</strong></span>.
